# Project2_soldier-race-project
This project involves exploring a dataset on body scales and race characteristics using the pandas module and researching domain knowledge online. The goal is to implement and compare Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and Random Forest algorithms, evaluating their performance with appropriate metrics. The best-performing model is selected and further improved using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. The final model is prepared for deployment, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed for interpretability. The project showcases a comprehensive approach from data exploration to model implementation and optimization, making it a valuable for learning and collaboration in the data science community.
